/**
 * A Trigger that automatically logs state changes to AdvantageKit.
 *
 * <p>This class extends WPILib's Trigger and adds automatic logging of the trigger's state whenever
 * it changes. The logging is handled internally without requiring external method calls.
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // In a subsystem, create a logged trigger that tracks when a beam break is triggered
 * public final LoggedTrigger broken = new LoggedTrigger("BeamBreak/Broken", beamBreak::isBroken);
 *
 * // The state will be automatically logged to "BeamBreak/Broken" whenever it changes
 * // Use it just like a normal Trigger
 * broken.onTrue(Commands.print("Beam is broken!"));
 * }</pre>
